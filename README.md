# Rust learning path

This repository is my own set of notes collected while teaching Rust, meant as
base to be forked for my students.

README contains categorized skills to be learned in the progress, it is not
closed, it will extend with time.

There is no timeframe in which particular skills should be learned. They are ordered
roughly in single categories, but ordering is not set in stone and depends on
natural learning path.

## General programming skills/tooling

### GitHub/GitLab (CI/CD)

- [ ] Managing repositories, forking
- [ ] Issues and PRs management
- [ ] Basic CI setup

### IDE

- [ ] Understanding chosen IDE (suggestions - VS: Code, Neovim or Emacs)
- [ ] Git integration setup
- [ ] Rust integration setup (suggestion - RA)

### Algorithms

- [ ] Big O notation
